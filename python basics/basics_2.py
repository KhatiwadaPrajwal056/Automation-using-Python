1. Introduction to Python (5 minutes)
Objective: Understand the purpose and capabilities of Python in automation.
Workflow:
Discuss the versatility of Python.
Explain Python's role in file organization, email automation, web scraping, GUI automation, and Selenium.
2. Basic Syntax and Data Types (15 minutes)
Objective: Learn basic data types and operations in Python.
Workflow:
Variables and Data Types: Introduce variables and show how to declare them with different data types.
Basic Operations: Demonstrate arithmetic operations and string concatenation.
python
Copy code
# Variables and Data Types
integer_var = 10
float_var = 20.5
string_var = "Hello, World!"
boolean_var = True

# Basic Operations
sum_result = integer_var + float_var
concat_result = string_var + " This is Python."
boolean_check = integer_var > float_var

print(sum_result)  # 30.5
print(concat_result)  # Hello, World! This is Python.
print(boolean_check)  # False
3. Control Structures (20 minutes)
Objective: Master the use of conditional statements and loops.
Workflow:
Conditional Statements: Explain if, elif, and else statements.
Loops: Describe the use of for and while loops.
Continue and Break: Introduce loop control statements continue and break.
python
Copy code
# Conditional Statements
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")

# Loops
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0 to 4

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Prints 0 to 4

# Continue and Break in Loops
for i in range(10):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop when i is 3
    if i == 8:
        break  # Exit the loop when i is 8
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
4. Functions (15 minutes)
Objective: Learn how to define and use functions.
Workflow:
Defining Functions: Show how to define a function using the def keyword.
Calling Functions: Explain how to call functions and pass arguments.
python
Copy code
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling a function
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Hello, Alice!
5. Lists and Dictionaries (20 minutes)
Objective: Understand how to work with lists and dictionaries.
Workflow:
Lists: Show how to create lists, access elements, and use list methods.
List Comprehension: Introduce list comprehension for concise list creation.
Dictionaries: Explain how to create and use dictionaries, access values, and iterate through items.
python
Copy code
# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']

# List Comprehension
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squared_numbers)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
print(person["name"])  # John
person["email"] = "john@example.com"
print(person)  # {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'email': 'john@example.com'}

# Iterating through a dictionary
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
# Output:
# name: John
# age: 30
# city: New York
# email: john@example.com
6. Error Handling (10 minutes)
Objective: Learn how to handle errors using try and except.
Workflow:
Try and Except: Introduce error handling with try and except blocks to catch exceptions.
python
Copy code
# Try and Except
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    result = "Undefined (division by zero)"
print(result)  # Undefined (division by zero)

try:
    int_value = int("abc")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError occurred: {e}")
